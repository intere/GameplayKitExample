// Notes: 
// As a discrete two-dimensional grid, where the only valid locations are those with integer coordinates. Use the GKGridGraph and GKGridGraphNode classes to create grid-based graphs. Figure 6-3 illustrates this format, which appears in many classic arcade games, board games, and tactical role-playing games.
